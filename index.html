      <h3>Why i took up programming</h3>
      <p>
        Since i completed my higschool diploma i have always wanted to pursue software development
        but due to lack of mentorship and guidance i found myself in a four year degree course in Economics but Now that i 
        am almost done i said why not? Atleast ill say i tried. I am fascinated by the idea of creating things and having them 
        come to life and impact the world in whichever way and Software Development Can help me realise that dream!
